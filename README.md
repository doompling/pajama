# Pajama Programming Language

Welcome! Pajama Lang is guided by a few principals:

1. Coziness
2. Tooling priority: Features that can't be quickly and well reasoned about by LSP won't be implemented. Macros will need special attention.
3. Simplify: Only bring the proven features from the last decades of web development, and bring the best version of them. Options and results over null values.
5. Developer Experience: Look for great trafe-offs to sacrafice a little resources to make the language more fun and productive. Lifetimes are first to go.
6. Source availability: The source should always be easily available. Third-party packages are stored within the project directory.
7. Boundaries: Function, thread, and async boundaries enforce locality.
